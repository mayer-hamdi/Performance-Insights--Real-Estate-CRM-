I HAVE ALLOT OFTIME THAT I DIDN'T MAKE A ZOOM MEETING  OR PHYSICAL MEETINGS 
WITH CLIENTS OR MEETING MAYBE I GET PRESENTATION AND NOT AVAILABE STATUES BUT THERE'S NO MEETING 

BTW THE SYSTEM IS IN THIS PATTERN OF COURSE NOT ALL PATTERNS BUT THIS IS THE MOST USED PATTERN FROM THE SALES " 
THE LEAD ASSIGN IN CAMPIGN 
1- NEEDS TO BE CONTACTED 
2- NO ANSWER (FIRST CALL) IF WE DIDN'T REACH HIM IN THE FIRST CALL 
2- NOT AVAILABE (IF HE / SHE ) TELLS YOU TO CALL HOIM IN ANOTHER TIME OER DIDN'T GIVE YOU THE FULL REQ 
3- PRESENTATION (YOU ALREADY TOOK A FULL REQ AND THE NEXT STEP IS TO DETER2MINE THE MEETING DATE)
4- MEETING SCHDULE / ZOOM MEETING SCH (IF THE MEETING IS SCHED)
5- PHYSICAL METING HAPPENED/ ZOOM MEETING HAPPEND  (IF THE ABOVE SCH MEETING IS HAPPEND )
6- ANOTHER MEETING HAPPEND (IF THER'S A NEED TO ANOTHER MEETINGS)
7- UNIT BLOCKED (IF THE CLIENT CHOOSED A UNIT AND XBLOCKED IT WITH AMOUNT OF MONEY)
8- UNIT RESERVATION 
9- DOWNPAYMENT 
10- (ONGRATES)THE CLIENT PAID THE DOWN PAYMENT AND CONTRACTED 

AS I REMEMBER THESE ALL THE POSITIVE STATUES THAT CAN THE SALES PERSON WALK THROUGH TO REACH TO CNTRACTED UNIT 


*** BTW THERE3'S 2 TYPES OF LEADS 
1- FRESH LEADS THAT THE CLIENT ASSIGN NOW ON THE CAMPIGN AND I CALL HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME 
2-EASSIGNED THAT THE CLIENT ASSIGNED AND WE DIDN'T REACH R ROTATED AND DIDN'T TAKE WITH THE LEAD POSITIVE ACTN 
OR WE TOOK POSITIVE ACTION AT THE FIRST AND DIDN'T COMPLETE THE PROCESS OF THIS SALES 


I TOLD YOU HTE STATUES BECAUSE OF MY PROBLEM 
I HAVE ALLOT OF TIME I DIDN'T GET MEETING (PHYSICAL MEETING HAPPEND / ZOOM MEETING HAPPEND ) 
AND I ALWAYS ASKED IF MY LEADS CLOSED OUTSIDE ME WHEN IT ROTATED IN ANY PHASE OF THESE ABOVE PHASES 
AND THE SALES MANAGER TOLD ME IF THE LEAD STILL IN HER ARM ZONE AND DIDN'T ROTATED TO ANOTHER
SALES MANAGER OR HEAD OF SALES SHE WILL KNOW IF THE LEAD CLOSED OUTSIDE ME OR NOT 
BUT IF THE LEAD ROTATED OUTSIDE THE ARM OF MY SALES MANAGER SHE'LLNOT KNOW 


AWW THAT'S GREAT EVEN THE LEAD CLOSED OUTSIDE ME BUT IN THE SAME ZONE OF MY SALES MANAGER OR OUT THE ZONE I HAVE TO KNOW 
KNOWING SUCH A THING WILL NOT MAKE DOWN BUT IT WILL MAKE ME KNOW THAT I HAVE PROBLEM IN MY SALES PROCESS 


***BTW THIS IS THE GENERAL HIRARCHY OF THE COMPANY OF SALES PEOPLE NOT DETAILED 
1- CEO 
2- HEAD OF SALES 
3- DIRECTOR 
4- SALES MANAGER 
5- TEAM LEADER 
6- AGENTS ( SENIOR - PC - FRESH )


HOW I WILL HAVE BENEFITS 
THE SALES PROCESS IS DEFINED 

THAT THE CLIENT ANSWER THE CALL 
MOST OF TIME I MAKE PRESENTATION STATUES BECAUSE THE CLIENT ANSWER 
SO I MADE HIME PRESENTATION 


***I HAVE ASSUMPTIONS 

1- HE DIDN;T ANSWER FROM THE FIRST TIME OR HE ANSWERED ME HE'S BUSY (I MUST FOLLOW UP WITH HIM UNTIL REACH HIME ) (PROBLEM --- FOLLOWING UP)


2- PRESENTATION ( I ALREADY MADE A SALES CALL FROM HIME SO I MUST SCHEDULED (MEETING OR ZOOM ) WITH THE CLIENT AT THE END OF THE CALL
OR SCHEDUALE ANOTHER CALL TO SCHEDUAL MEETING WITH HIM ) (PROBLEM --- SCHEDULLING MEETING )

3- MEETING SCHEDUALE ( I MUST SOLD MYSELF TO THE CLIENT AND MADE HIME FEEL OK WITH ME TO ENTER THE MEETING ) (PROBLEM -- DIDN'T SELL MYSELF ENOUGH // GIVE HIM MUCH INFO HE DOESN'T NEED ME ANYMORE)

4- PHYSICAL MEETING AND ANOTHE MEETING HAPPENED (I MUST MAKE THE CLIENT RESERVE A UNIT OR FOLLOW UP WITH ME UNTILL RESERVE THE UNIT ) ((PROBLRM -- CLOSING PROBLEMS )

AND THEN THE REST OF STATUES EXCPTIONS AND CLOSING PROBLEMS IF IT DID'T DONE 


SOOOO ---- HOW I WILL KNOW THAT I HAVE A PROBLEM AS A SALES PERSON IN ONE OR MANY OF THESE STAGES
 IF I DIDN'T THAT THERE'S ANOTHER PERSON CLOSED A  OR MADE A POSITIVE ACTION ON THE LEAD 
 THAT I MADE A POSITIVE ACTION ON IT BEFORE 

THEN --------- I WILL MADE AN OVERVIEW ON THE DASH BOARD THAT I SENT BEFORE THAT TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE TWO THINGS

*******BTW 
THE POSITIVE ACTIONS ARE : THAT THE SALES PERSON CHANGE THE STATUES OF THE LEAD THAT HAD BEEN COLD FROM THE PREVIOUS SALES PERSON TO ANOTHEER STATUES THAT MOVES FORWARD IN THE SALES PROCESS
 




ERROR RATE

A PERCENTAGE ARROW  IN THE CHART THAT INCRESE WHEN  YOU HAD A LEAD AND HAD A POSITIVE ACTION ON IT AND ROTATED THROUGH THE CRM AFTER BEING COLD IN YOUR CRM AND ANOTHERR SALES PRSON TOOK A POSITIVE ACTION ON IT AND TABEL E THAT DEVIDED INTO COLUMNS ONE IS THE STAGE AND THE ANOTHER IS PERCENTAGE OF THE LEAD THAT TOOK A POSITIVE ACIONS OUTSIDE YOU 


 

SUCSSESS RATE
LIKE THE ERROR RATE BUT IF YOU MADE A POSTIVE ACTION ON THE LEAD THAT COLD AND HAVE NEGATIVE ACTION ON IT AND YOU MOVE FOROWARD WITH THE LEAD   
 


**** * THE PERCENTAGE OF ERROR RATE WILL BE CALCULATED BY THE PERSENTAGE OF THE FRESH LEADS I TOOK AND ROTATED AND CLOSED OUTSIDE ME OR TOOK A POSITIVE ACTIONS OUTSIDE ME AFTER BEING COLD IN MY STATUES 

***** THE PERCENTAGE OF SUCSSESS RATE WILL BE BY THE PERSENTAGE OF THE FRESH LEADS I TOOK AND I CLOSED OR THE FORWARD POSITIVE ACTIONS I TOOK WITH REASSIGNED LEADS THAT I MOVE FORWEARD WITH POSITIB=VE ACTIONS WITH THE LEAD THAT REASSIGNED THAT WAS A FRESH LEAD OF OTHER SALES PRSONE 



IS THAT WILL BE JUST FOR SALES AGENTS NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
THIS ALSO WILL BE THE WHOLE HIRARCHY BECAUSE THEY ARE ALSO RESBONSIBLE OF THE SALES PERSONE STAGES AND SALES PERSON 


THEN WHYYYYYYYYY ?????????

THE MAIN 2 EMOTIONS THAT DRIVE THE SALES PERSONS IS 
THE NEED 
THE JELOUCY 

IF THE SALES PERSON SEE WICH STAGE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT IT WILL BE VERY HELPFUL FOR HIM AND THAT WILL HELP THAT WITH HIS MANAGER 
IF THE SALES PERSON SAW THAT HE DOESN’T MADE HIS WORK AS GOOD AS ENOUGH THIS WILL MAKE HIM JELOUCE THIS WILL MAKE HIME THE NEXT TIME KILL HIM FOR THE LEAD TO COLOSE IT AND KNOW THAT HE HAS THE PROBLEM NOT GOD GIVES THE PROBLEM 

THIS WILL BE APLLYED EVEN THE LEAD TOOK A POSITIVE ACTION IN ANOTHER HEAD OF SALES ARM NO TJUST SALES MANAGER THIS WILL BE APPLIED IN THE ENTIER SALES TEAM IN THE COMPANY 



I WANT TO KNOW IS THIS PROBLEM IS REAL AND IS THERE A SATSFACTORY SUBSTITUTION FOR IT
