# Real Estate CRM Enhancement: Performance & Productivity Suite

## 🎯 Project Overview
A comprehensive product initiative to solve critical, firsthand operational problems in real estate sales workflows. This project demonstrates a full product cycle—from identifying a widespread pain point on the frontlines, to designing, prototyping, and documenting a data-driven solution.

**Live Interactive Prototype:** [[🔗 View the Full Interactive Figma Prototype Here](https://www.figma.com/make/phhFC4zbvabMbah1jor1xu/Create-CRM-Dashboard-Prototype?t=U3Yek6tWxDdhFEaF-1)]

## 🔍 The Core Problems
While working directly with clients and managing high-volume sales pipelines, I consistently encountered two systemic issues that reduce team efficiency and agent growth:

1.  **The Feedback Gap in Sales Performance:** There was no systematic way for sales agents to receive feedback on *where* in the funnel they were losing opportunities. If a lead they worked on was rotated and later converted by another agent, that critical learning data was lost, making improvement guesswork.
2.  **The Daily Planning Disconnect:** Daily task management was fragmented. Agents and managers lacked a unified, time-aware view of priorities, leading to misalignment, missed follow-ups, and a lack of structured daily workflow.

**Solution Validation:** These problems were qualitatively validated through discussions with multiple peers in similar roles, confirming they were team-wide challenges needing a tool-based solution.

## 🛠️ The Proposed Solution
I designed an integrated suite of two features that work within a CRM dashboard to close these gaps:

### 1. Performance Insights Dashboard
-   **Purpose:** Transform lost opportunities into learning moments.
-   **Core Concept:** Introduces a **"Stage-Specific Opportunity Loss Rate"** metric. It visually answers: "When I advance a lead to the Presentation stage, what percentage convert later with someone else?"
-   **Value:** Enables precise, data-driven coaching and self-assessment for sales agents.

### 2. Collaborative Daily Planner
-   **Purpose:** Create alignment and structure in daily execution.
-   **Core Features:**
    -   **Time-Blocked Schedule:** Tasks are organized in a hourly timeline, not just a list.
    -   **Shared Task Management:** Both agents and managers can create, assign, and comment on tasks.
    -   **Daily Recap & Notes:** A dedicated section for end-of-day summaries and setting next-day priorities, ensuring continuous alignment.

| **[`01-research-problem-definition/`](01-research-problem-definition/)** | The foundational research: a detailed problem statement and notes from user interviews validating the pain points. |
| **[`02-product-definition/`](02-product-definition/)** | The product blueprint: complete Product Requirements Document (PRD), user stories, and defined success metrics. |
| **[`03-design-prototype/`](03-design-prototype/)** | The design journey: from initial wireframes to the final high-fidelity, interactive Figma prototype. |
| **[`04-project-management/`](04-project-management/)** | A snapshot of the project timeline and workflow, managed in Jira. |

**🎨 Experience the Solution:** The best way to understand this proposal is to interact with it. **[Access the main Figma prototype here.]([https://www.figma.com/make/phhFC4zbvabMbah1jor1xu/Create-CRM-Dashboard-Prototype?t=U3Yek6tWxDdhFEaF-1])**

## 🧭 My Product Process
This project is a practical application of product management fundamentals:
1.  **Empathize & Define:** Leveraged my frontline experience to identify and then formally define the core problems, ensuring they were user-validated.
2.  **Ideate & Scope:** Structured the solution through a PRD, focusing on clear user outcomes and measurable goals.
3.  **Prototype & Validate:** Translated ideas into a tangible, interactive prototype using wireframing and modern design tools (Figma), facilitating concrete feedback.
4.  **Plan & Execute:** Self-managed the project using agile principles (Jira) to progress systematically from concept to a demonstrable solution.

## 🚀 How to Navigate
1.  **For a Quick Overview:** Look at the prototype and skim the Problem Statement.
2.  **To Understand Product Thinking:** Read the PRD in `02-product-definition/`.
3.  **To See the Process:** Browse through the wireframes and project timeline.

## 🤝 Connect & Discuss
I built this project to demonstrate my hands-on approach to solving real-world business problems through product thinking, design, and execution. I'm always keen to discuss product strategy, UX, and proptech innovation.
